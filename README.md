# EndavaMed-Intership20201
In this repository I will post all exercises I have done during my internship in endava.
It will be divided in 4 areas, and this will help me to know the pending tasks and their priority:
Front: Finish rock paper scissors js logic. LOW
Back: Factory pattern presentation. HIGH
Testing: Finish the Selenium course. HIGH
Devops: Katacoda exercises. MEDIUM
